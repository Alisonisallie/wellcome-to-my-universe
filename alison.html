            <h2 align="left">1. My Chinese name: LEE YU SHAN </h2>
            <h2 align="left">2. Nationality: Taiwan (Taipei)</h2>
                             <P>I am a Taiwanese girl who lives in Taipei, a northern city in Taiwan. Taipei the capital city of Taiwan, is a modern cosmopolitan metropolis with a lively and diversified face, filled with exuberance. The polarities of Taipei are vividly present as well in the joining of the urban and natural. The city owns plenty of trails, parks, and other oases of tranquility to lift and invigorate your spirits. Various night markets, Taipei 101, Yangmingshan National Park, temples, etc., there are many wonderful places to be your destination. Anyway, I hope everyone visits Taipei City once in their lifetime </P>
